-----Group Contributions-----

El Tetris write up and code was done by David McMorrow (16338955)

Genetic Algorithm write up and code was done by Jack Mac Namara (16321927)

Cross entrophy write up and code was done by Matthew Runswick (16316898)

Deep Q learning write up and code was done by Laura Fortune (16322647)


--------How to run the code ---------

The implementation of each of the algorithims is done on a seperate branch in this repository.

The instructions for accessing and running the code for each implemented algorithim is described below.



-----How to run El Tetris-----

Move to the el tetris Branch on this repository.

Run main_menu.py, using <python main_menu.py

You will be greeted by:

From this screen you select "Train AI"

The following screen will be seen and you select El-Tetris and the project will run from there.

-----How to run Genetic Algorithm-----

Move to the geneticAlg Branch on this repository.

Run main_menu.py, using python main_menu.py

You will be greeted by:

From this screen you select "Train AI"

The following screen will be seen and you select "Train Fair AI" and the project will run from there.

-------------How to run the cross entrophy algorithim -------------------

Move to the cross-entropy branch on this repository.

Run main_menu.py, using python main_menu.py

The you will see a screen similar to those displayed above, select the cross entrophy button and the model will start to play tetris.

There are two functions, one to train the model and one to test the choosen (trained) model. You can switch between modes by toggeling between the two lines of code shown below, currently it is set that the model just plays with the trained weights. This code is located on line 56 and 57 of the main_menu.py file.

NOTE: if you click off of the tetris screen it can sometimes freeze, this is just a visual problem, the code is still running in the background


---------How to run the deep q learning algorithim -------------------

Move to the deep q learning branch on this repository.

Run main_menu.py, using python main_menu.py

You will see a screen similar to those displayed above. To see the network training select 'Train AI', the following screen will appear and you can select 'Train Fair AI'

To see the trained model play select 'Play vs AI' on the original menu screen, on the new screen select the 'Watch' button located beside 'Play vs Fair AI'
